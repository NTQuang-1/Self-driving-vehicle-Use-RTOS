# Autonomous-vehicle-Use-RTOS
In this project, I am using the freeRTOS system to handle three tasks: one to control the vehicle over the Bluetooth wireless communication protocol, Task 2 for the autonomous vehicle, and another to collect data from ultrasonic sensors. The goal is to enhance vehicle stability during the transition between these three tasks.
